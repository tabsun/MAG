# MAG: a framework to fool an ensemble of object detectors

> Top 5 solution for [CIKM 2020 AnalytiCup adversarial challenge on object detection](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531806/introduction).

# Requirements

  - PyTorch
  - mmdetection
  - numpy, opencv-python, etc

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 1000 images from MS COCO.
Get the dataset from [here](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/531806/introduction).
# Run
  You can run:
  ```sh
  $ python adv_close.py
  ```
  The code contains a lot of experiment code. I will keep updating it.
